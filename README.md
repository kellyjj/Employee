# Employee

this is my 1st .net core mvc app.   I did not use the entity frame work.    this is a excercise in learning.

it's a simple app that so far, that either adds a employee or shows all the employees.

some dependicies:

  this was written in vs code
  developed on Linux Mint 20.2 Uma
  sql server database.
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
  dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
